## Aim
This repository is aim to practice molecule representations and predictive neural networks by predicting pKa of small molecules. The practice dataset (downloaded from [here](https://github.com/czodrowskilab/Machine-learning-meets-pKa/blob/master/datasets/combined_training_datasets_unique.sdf)) used in this repository contains 5994 molecules in total.

The RMSE of literature reported pKa predictions is between 0.50 and 1. Such models are trained on datasets including millions of molecules.
