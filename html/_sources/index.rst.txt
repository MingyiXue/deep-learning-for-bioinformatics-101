.. note::

   This tutorial is still under development. 
   In case that the open resource materials may be too long to read, 
   the following chapters will be prepared in the future, 
   in order to introduce deep learning using chem/bioinformatics tasks directly, 
   instead of using tasks such as classification of hand-written digits.

   - chapters/quickstart
   - chapters/notations
   - chapters/datasets
   - chapters/representations
   - chapters/predictive
   - chapters/generative
   - chapters/toolkits
