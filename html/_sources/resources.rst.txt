    - Dive into Deep Learning: 
      `Book <https://d2l.ai>`__ | `STAT 157 Course at UC Berkeley <https://courses.d2l.ai/berkeley-stat-157/index.html>`__
    - Deep Learning: `Book <https://www.deeplearningbook.org>`__
    - Machine learning practices using ``scikit-learn``: `Tutorial <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`__
    - Deep learning practices using ``pytorch``: `Tutorial <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/index.html>`__
- Introduction to deep learning in chem/bioinformatics:
    - ``DeepChem`` is a Python toolkit for chem/bioinformatics, containing benchmark datasets 
      and implementations of published deep learning models for each learning task. 
      These models are usually a good start for reproducing purposes before developing your own new methods. 
      `Tutorial <https://deepchem.io/tutorials/the-basic-tools-of-the-deep-life-sciences/>`__ | `GitHub repo <https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem>`__
    - ``BioPython`` is a comprehensive Python package for bioinformatics, 
      especially handling biomolacular sequences. 
      This package is useful when preprocessing sequence data for deep learning. 
      The tutorial provides detailed practices about handling various file formats, 
      connecting to online databases, aligning and clustering sequences, etc.

    - ``RDKit`` is an open source package for cheminformatics, 
      especially handling small molecular structures. 
      This package is useful when preprocessing molecular structures for deep learning. 
      The tutorial provides practices about handling various file formats, 
      visualizing molecules, calculating molecular properties, 
      converting structures to molecular graphs, etc.

.. tip:: Searching Tricks

   1. When you want to start a new topic of interest,
   try searching `awesome-<something you are interested in>`, e.g. `awesome deep learning`. 
   It will lead you to GitHub repositories containing a comprehensive list of materials in this field.

   2. After reading through a brief overview, when you want to search programming practices,
   try including the keyword `hands-on` / `cookbook` / `recipe`, e.g. `hands-on deep learning`. 
   It will result in more example-driven materials other than fundamental knowledge.
